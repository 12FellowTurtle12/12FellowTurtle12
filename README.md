- 👋 Hi, I’m @12FellowTurtle12
- 👀 I’m interested in history, linguistics, philosophy (including STEM philosophy, apparently since Charles Sanders Peirce is one of my influences), philology, politics and open-source
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding (in general), French and PhD on philology
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything that will help me learn
- 📫 You can reach me through my GitHub, I am not planning a coding career
- 😓 Can not code, please dont bully
